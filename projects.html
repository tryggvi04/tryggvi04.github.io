                <h2 id="project_title">Boss rush</h2>
                <p>A video game in which you face against bossess, it's my first proper 3D game (not counting ones I did as a kid), so working with Blender and rigging has been a challenge. I'm figuring it out though, it's in very early stages.
                    You do damage by inputting a sequence in the correct order. The bossess have big attacks and indicators for them. It's being made in Godot

                <p>A video game my friends and I made during the 3-week game design course we took in RU.
                    It's a metroidvania where the player can possess enemies and then fight as them!
                    It was a really great experience doing a big project like this in only ~2 weeks.
                    I did most of the programming and engine stuff.
                    We used C# to code everything, and used the Unity engine.

                <h2 id="project_title">Grimoire</h2>
                <p>A video game my friends and I started making in our freshman year! 
                    It was a roguelike deckbuilder where the player would move around fighting rooms of enemies and then get new spells to put in their deck.
                    We made it in Godot, using GDScript. I did most of the coding and level design.

                <p>Monkey Business was a final project for a semester in college. It was a job application page that we made with Django.
                    We used Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.

                <p>A game I made when I was 13 years old using GameMaker Studio. I loved the Henry Stickmin games growing up, so I wanted to recreate that style. Then I realized how much effort animation takes— even bad animation! 
                Still, I'm very proud of it considering I was only 13.
