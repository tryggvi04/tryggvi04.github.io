            <p>A video game in which you face against bossess, it was my first proper 3D game (not counting ones I did as a kid), so working with Blender and rigging has been a challenge. I'm figuring it out though, it's in very early stages.
                You do damage by inputting a sequence in the correct order. The bossess have big attacks and indicators for them. It's being made in Godot

            <p>A video game my friends and I made during the 3-week game design course we took in RU.
                It's a metroidvania where the player can possess enemies and then fight as them!
                It was a really great experience doing a big project like this in only ~2 weeks.
                I did most of the programming and engine stuff.
                We used C# to code everything, and used the Unity engine.

                It was a roguelike deckbuilder where the player would move around fighting rooms of enemies and then get new spells to put in their deck.
                We made it in Godot, using GDScript. I did most of the coding and level design.

            Still, I'm very proud of it considering I was only 13.
