            <h2 id="project_title">Shadow Lightning</h2>
            <p>A video game my friends and I made during the 3-week game design course we took in RU.
                It's a metroidvania where the player can possess enemies and then fight as them!
                It was a really great experience doing a big project like this in only ~2 weeks.
                I did most of the programming and engine stuff.
                We used C# to code everything, and used the Unity engine, check it out <a href="https://tryggvi04.itch.io/shadow-lightning">here on itch.io!</a>

            <h2 id="project_title">Grimoire</h2>
            <p>A video game my friends and I started making in our freshman year! 
                It was a roguelike deckbuilder where the player would move around fighting rooms of enemies and then get new spells to put in their deck.
                We made it in Godot, using GDScript. I did most of the coding and level design.
